# DC101_Whack_A_Mole_UmaliClarence
Why this design works:
Cubic-Bezier Transition: In the CSS, the transition for the mole isn't just "linear." It has a slight "bounce" at the top, making it feel more organic.

Visual Feedback: The neon glow and the dark background create a high-contrast environment that keeps the player focused.

Hole Masking: By using overflow: hidden on the hole, we create the illusion of the mole coming out of the ground rather than just appearing out of thin air.
